# Multi-Game_Management_System_Oracle_DB_Project
---

## **Project Overview**  
This project is a **relational database** designed to manage data for a game company with multiple games that share a similar structure. The database supports key game elements such as player accounts, guilds, quests, and an inventory/shop system, while allowing for future scalability and feature expansion.  

Developed using **Oracle SQL**, the project focuses on:  
- **Efficient database design**  
- **Query optimization**  
- **Relational data modeling**  

This project marks the beginning of my journey in **database development**, and while it may not be perfect, it serves as a strong foundation for learning and growth. I use this repository to **document my progress** as I continue to improve and refine the project.



## **Features**  
*(To be added in future updates.)*  



## **Database Design**  
This database represents my **first project** in the world of data, and while it may not be perfectly designed or fully optimized, it reflects a solid starting point. The relational model is structured to manage entities such as player accounts, characters, quests, guilds, and shops while maintaining data consistency.  

As an **ongoing process**, Iâ€™m actively working to improve its efficiency, scalability, and functionality. This repository serves as a place to **track my progress** and document the learning process, as I explore database design principles, query optimization, and best practices.
