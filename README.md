# Multi-Game_Management_System_Oracle_DB_Project


# **Project overview**

This project is a relational database designed to manage data for a game company with multiple games that share a similar structure. The database supports key game elements such as player accounts, guilds, quests, an inventory/shop system and other addional elements, while allowing for future scalability and feature expansion.

Developed using Oracle SQL, the project focuses on:

Efficient database design
Query optimization
Relational data modeling


# **Features** 
 (To be added in future updates)
 

# **Database Design**

This database represents my first project in the world of data, and while it may not be perfectly designed or fully optimized, it reflects a solid starting point. The relational model is structured to manage entities such as player accounts, characters, quests, guilds, shops/mercahnts and additional ones, while maintaining data consistency.

As an ongoing process, Iâ€™m actively working to improve its efficiency, scalability, and functionality. This repository serves as a place to track my progress and document the learning process, as I explore database design principles, query optimization, and best practices.
